## Introduction

This software is a mobile cross-platform work-life integration tool developed using the latest version of Compose Multiplatform. It aims to provide modern workers with a one-stop platform for managing **work hours, schedules and countdown days, memos, and monthly savings**. Data can be synchronized to the cloud via the official account system or a self-built server, ensuring 100% recovery of original records when switching devices. The UI is based on Google's Material Design 3, making the interface both beautiful and user-friendly.

### 1. Working Hours

### 2. Schedules and Countdown Days

### 3. Memos
